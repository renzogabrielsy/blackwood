-- Exclude SUNDRIED (re-dried, non-incoming) deliveries from ALL analytics views
-- powering the Summaries feature (By Period + By Supplier).
--
-- WHAT "SUNDRIED" MEANS
-- ---------------------
-- "Sundried" material is internal, RE-PROCESSED stock that came out of the plant's
-- own sun-drying area (locally "layupan"). It is NOT a genuine external supplier
-- delivery -- the charcoal was already counted as incoming when it first arrived;
-- after being re-dried it is logged again under a SUNDRY batch / a "Layupan" origin.
-- Counting it in price/volume analysis would double-count tonnage and pollute the
-- supplier list with a fake "Layupan" supplier and origin-traced "X - BLOCK" rows.
--
-- THE EXCLUSION (verified against live data: 247 rows / 3,763,004.49 kg removed,
-- leaving 1,190 incoming rows / 22,901,122.60 kg):
--   batch_code ILIKE '%SUNDR%'   -> SUNDRY / SUNDRIED / SUNDRYING batch codes
--   supplier   ILIKE '%layupan%' -> "Layupan" = the sun-drying AREA, not a supplier
--   supplier   ILIKE '%sundr%'   -> any sundry-tagged origin string
--   remarks    ILIKE '%sundr%'   -> rows flagged sundry in remarks
--
-- This migration ONLY adds the row filter above (AND-ed into each view's existing
-- WHERE transaction_date IS NOT NULL). All weighting rules are unchanged:
--   * ledger L-008: price aggregates over cost_basis > 0 rows only (volume counts all)
--   * lab metrics: volume-weighted with FILTER excluding null/non-numeric keys
-- Column shapes are identical, so types/supabase.ts is unaffected.
